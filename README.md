This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala when working with Futures: unhandled exceptions. The `bug.scala` file shows code that throws an exception within a Future.  The `bugSolution.scala` file provides a corrected version that properly handles the exception using `recover` or similar techniques.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling when dealing with asynchronous operations in Scala.
